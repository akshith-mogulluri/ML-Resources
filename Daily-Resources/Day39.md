# Day 39 Teaching Myself Machine Learning Everyday

I feel I have been spending far too much time understanding Lagrange multipliers. But in reality, the majority of my time isn't really learning about lagrange multipliers. After not studying Calclus and Linear Algebra for over 3 years, I have forgotten the a lot of the low-level math concepts that build these things I am learning.
While I am relearning these high level concepts I am also relearning all the calculus and LA topics I have forgotten. So, although me studying SVMs/Lagrangians/GD/HP..etc is taking a while, I am fine with it because the majority of my time isn't spent studying the high level things, but rather relearning the important low-level calc/LA theory that will be repeated in a lot of ML algorithms.
