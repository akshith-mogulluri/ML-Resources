# Day 44

Before I move back to coding my SVM implimentation I need to connect all the dots for the SVM dual derivation. To do this I went through a video providing me with hand written examples of the SVM dual function. This video was inspired because as I was doing these 'by hand' derivations I realized I had used the dot product countless times...
