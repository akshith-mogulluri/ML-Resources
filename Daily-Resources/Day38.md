# Day 38 Resources :)

Focus today: Math behind ML optimization, specifically regarding the implimentation and use of the lagrangian with inequality constraints. 

I keep running into road blocks in my understanding of the intuion & derivation of the Lagrangian (as applied to an SVM) - usually meaning I am missing some fundamental piece of information. 
So I decided to take a step backwards and ensure I have a solid understanding of a basic lagrangian and basic optimization theory/math.
